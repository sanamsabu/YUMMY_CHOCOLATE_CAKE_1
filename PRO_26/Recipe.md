First take a large bowl and beat 2 eggs with 1 cup of powdered sugar and beat till a bit fluffy.

​
Now add 1/2 cup oil ,1/2 cup milk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence  and beat it till it is  a bit white in colour

Now sieve in 1 cup Maida and 1/3 cup cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder , 1/2 teaspoon baking soda,1/4 tsp salt and whisk (never beat after adding Maida and baking powder)...

​


To bake the cake first transfer the cake batter into a baking pan dusted with flour. Now put the baking pan inside an aluminium pressure cooker close the lid,make sure that you remove the weight of the cooker . Keep the cooker in low flame for atleast 45 mins...

​
When the cake is baked there would be steam coming out from the hole of lid...Then take the cake out and keep it for cooling...

​

Now lets go to my favorite part which is icing


So here we are doing chocolate icing so for that we have to melt 1 cup of chopped chocolate .....After the chocolate is completely melted keep it aside.

​
Next take a large bowl and beat 1 1/2 cup of whipping cream until peak forms.. When it reaches the peak add the melted chocolate to it and beat it again.

​

Next prepare dark chocolate ganache by adding dark chocolate to warm whipping cream and allowing it to remain for 3-4minutes to get a syrupy chocolate ganache. Cut the cake into 2 layers and place it in a cake board now add sugar syrup to the first layer, then add an amount of cream you want  in your first layer

​

Now put the second layer of the cake  and put some sugar syrup and apply the whipped cream frosting on the top and sides of the cake and smoothen it over with a  spatula.... you can use a brush to give a zigzag design on the sides of the cake. 

​

GANACHE 

Take 1/4 cup of hot cream and add 3-4 tbsp of chocolate to it and mix till it looks like melted chocolate 

Take dark chocolate ganache in a piping bag and apply along the edges of the cake and let it drip along the sides of the cake at intervals .

You can decorate according to your wish. Here i piped out the whipped cream frosting using a star nozzle to create roses at the edges of the cake and poured the remaining ganache in the centre and spread out with a spoon to gently cover the top of the cake.
Yummy chocolate cake is ready to eat !!!
